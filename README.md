# Mental-health-Analysis-
📌 Overview
This project was part of a Kaggle hackathon focused on analyzing mental health data. The goal was to develop a machine learning model that predicts mental health conditions based on survey responses, demographics, and other relevant factors.

📂 Dataset
The dataset includes responses related to mental health awareness, past experiences, workplace support, and demographic details. Key features include:

Age, Gender 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

Workplace Support for Mental Health 🏢

History of Mental Health Issues 🏥

Treatment Accessibility & Stigma Factors 🚑

Survey Responses on Mental Health Perception 📝

🛠 Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)

Machine Learning (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression)

Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Feature Engineering & Hyperparameter Tuning

📊 Approach
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values and categorical data encoding.

Performed outlier detection and feature scaling.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized the distribution of mental health conditions.

Identified correlations between workplace policies and mental health impact.

3️⃣ Model Development
Implemented Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression models.

Optimized model performance using GridSearchCV and feature selection.

4️⃣ Evaluation
Used accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to compare models.

Achieved [insert best model performance] with [best model name].

🔍 Key Insights
✔️ Workplace support significantly impacts mental health conditions.
✔️ Younger age groups report higher mental health concerns.
✔️ Individuals with past mental health history are more likely to seek treatment.

🚀 Future Improvements
🔹 Integrating deep learning models for better prediction.
🔹 Expanding dataset by incorporating external mental health trends.
🔹 Deploying the model using a web app for interactive use.
